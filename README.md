## Project structure

Whishper is a collection of pieces that work together. The three main pieces are:

- Transcription-API: This is the API that enables running Faster-Whisper. You can find it in the `transcription-api` folder.
- Whishper-Backend: This is the backend that coordinates frontend calls, database, and tasks. You can find it in `backend` folder.
- Whishper-Frontend: This is the frontend (web UI) of the application. You can find it in `frontend` folder.
- Translation (3rd party): This is the libretranslate container that is used for translating subtitles.
- MongoDB (3rd party): This is the database that stores all the information about your transcriptions.
- Nginx (3rd party): This is the proxy that allows running everything from a single domain.
